    Hello, World!
</div>

I've never written a blog before.  It has to start somewhere, doesn't it?

## What to expect

Basically, the motivation for starting this is to share some images of things to get more things.  DangerousPrototypes has such an offer for their prototype PCBs, also the DirtyPCBs service (same people?) has similar coupons if the result of one of those projects is shared on the internet.

As I'm working on something, I'll want to share it on the internet to get coupons for the next thing.

I guess I could've used Twitter or Facebook or something for this, but I wanted to learn about GitHub more.

There are other reasons for blogging too.  I'd like to share pictures of projects with people.  I might treat it as a kind of journal.  Sites like Hackaday have unsatisfying options for uploading BOMs for projects.  Also it might be a useful self-management kind of tool.
