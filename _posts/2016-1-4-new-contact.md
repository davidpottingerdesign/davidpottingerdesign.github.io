title: Changed My Contact
---

Some kind of maintanence.  Thought I shouldn't just have my email address on "about".  Hence, a contact form.  Added a new "contact" page for this.  It was formatted in html, so I didn't get to use a simple "page" set up in Lanyon.  Oh well.

I'll try this Cognito forms service first I suppose.  There seem to be at least a dozen competing copies of approximately the same thing.  Not about to spend much on any of them.

I guess next I should think about some kind of post index?  Maybe I should be adding tags all along for people to sort these posts.

But if you have suggestions for how I should do things, now you can go to davidpottingerdesign.github.io/contact and tell me!
