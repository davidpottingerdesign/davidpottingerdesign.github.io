title: More ESP8266 and Screen
---

### Screen skill
The one screen command that kept me from using it for everything was the one to disconnect

{% highlight bash %}
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600
screen -ls
screen -r 3200 -X kill
{% endhighlight %}

Where 3200 is the example reply from the -ls command.

### Some more ESP8266
Lua comments are "--" (double hyphen), so I can use that in init.lua to save a bunch maybe.

It looks like other products connect over USB and have a GUI to ask for SSID and password.  It'd be nice to be able to set those by commandline on startup.

### Arduino?
Lots of example stuff using arduino.  Sparkfun has its "Thing" but I'd like to try my cheaper one first.

Programs just fine with blinky.  Only visible LED by default is on TX on GPIO2.

More to come.
