<p class="message">
  I am blogging to keep track of my electronics and computer projects and share them.

GitHub offers free hosting for pages such as these and suggested Jekyll as a static blog generator.  I was having a little trouble until I found poole (https://github.com/poole).  Thanks everyone!

## More about me

My name is David Pottinger.  I've been working for a little while now and things are starting to get more exciting.

I studied electrical engineering at San Diego State University and graduated in 2012.  I grew up and live in San Diego, California.  You may contact me at davidpottingerdesign@gmail.com.

I follow the usual electronics material on the internet.  There are news/blog websites like Hackaday or the blog section on Adafruit.  There are many youtube channels like Dave Jones' EEVBlog.  I learned how to use KiCAD through some Contextual Electronics tutorials free on youtube.

I'm currently using Linux Mint with Cinnamon.

## More about projects

There are some day jobs I won't want to write about.  Some of the day job is like marketing though and people will like seeing it on the blog.  In particular, I've been working with a Microchp design partner for a few years and I'm happy to relate my experiences with their products.

At work there more Windows tools but at home I have many Linux options available.  Not all software I use is open source unfortunately.  Most of my private projects use free software.  My projects tend to use hardware, but the cost of these things has been going down recently.

Hopefully this blog will be one of the successes!

Thanks for reading!
