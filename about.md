I am blogging to keep track of my electronics and computer projects and share them.

I've been working with a Microchp design partner for a few years and I'm happy to relate my experiences with their products.

For my private projects, I've been using services such as OSHPark or DirtyPCBs.  I buy components from distributors like Mouser.

GitHub offers free hosting for pages such as these and suggested Jekyll as a static blog generator.  I was having a little trouble until I found poole (https://github.com/poole).  Thanks everyone!

## More about me

My name is David Pottinger.  I've been working for a little while now and things are starting to get more exciting.

I studied electrical engineering at San Diego State University and graduated in 2012.  I learned more than a few useful things at school but the tools have changed already.  I grew up and live in San Diego, California.  You may contact me at davidpottingerdesign@gmail.com.

I follow the usual electronics material on the internet.  There are news/blog websites like Hackaday or the blog section on Adafruit.  There are many youtube channels like Dave Jones' EEVBlog.  KiCAD tutorials from Contextual Electronics were free and very useful.  All the important stuff to learn is out there.

I'm currently using Linux Mint with Cinnamon.

Thanks for reading!
