I am blogging to sort out my thoughts and ideas.  I don't expect anyone else to go through these, this is mostly for my benefit.  I have clutters of paper running around everywhere so I hope using the internet will be easier to keep a hold of.

I am active with a local church, San Diego Church of Christ.  Some of my ideas will be religious, Christian.  Others may be related to electronics work.

Thanks for reading!
